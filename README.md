# Social_Network_Analytics_Project

Goal - The project looked to employ social network analytics to deconstruct the group-shopping behaviour amongst the customers of a major retail giant. The goal was to identify insightful patterns within the retailer's customer base to help them create an optimised marketing strategy. Answering questions like "Which are the most important customers for the retail company?", "Which are the most important friend circles?" and "Do customers shop with people with a similar spending behaviour to them?" was a key objective.

Process - The project consisted of four modules :-
1. Network Analysis - Worked with Python package 'NetworkX' to deconstruct friendship networks, build network diagrams, find the most important customers and the most important sub-networks, the most 'central' customers, and much more.

2. Data Engineering and Manipulation - Expanded the initial set of five features to derive 17+ new features that offered much broader insight and perspective into the customer behaviour. Some of the newly derived features were "Number of shopping trips with friends for each customer", "Average revenue of all friends for each customer", "Similarity of a customer with their friends based on net spend", and many more.
3. Clustering and Correlation Analysis - Customer clusters were made based on the customers' net spend towards the retail company as well as on the average number of shopping friends for each customer.
4. Data Visualisation - Insights and patterns were derived and visualised using Tableau and d3.js. 

Result - Four key questions were answered through the project :-
1. Which are the most pivotal customers for the retail company?/Which customers should they spend their marketing dollars on?
2. How do friendships or group-shopping behaviour impact customer spend?
3. Do friendships/networks differ in characteristics with zip codes?
4. Are relationships balanced?/Do customers have friends with similar net spends?
